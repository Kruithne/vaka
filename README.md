Vaka is a tiny JavaScript library that provides a reactive state system inspired by Vue.js.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Active Development

This library is actively in the early stages of development. Feedback is welcome, however I highly recommend not using Vaka in production until v1.

## Features

Coming Soon

## Motivation

Reactivity as a concept is great for web development. It allows the gap between HTML (DOM) and JS to be bridged much more seamlessly, getting rid of endless boilerplate.

But to get reactivity, you often need to bring in the whole kitchen. Vue.js is my favourite reactive framework, however pulling in a 400kb file just to get reactivity feels unnecessary, and I often end up just going without - cost outweighs benefit.

I built Vaka to try a fresh approach at reactivity, without building a rocketship.

## Footnotes

Vaka is inspired by the concepts of Vue.js. A lot of terminology may be carried over as coming up with a whole new appendix of terminology just to be unique is confusing and pointless.

The name Vaka comes from Old Norse; to watch, to keep a watchful eye.
